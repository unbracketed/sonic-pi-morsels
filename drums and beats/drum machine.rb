#Drum Machine
#Coded by Davids Fiddle

#How to use:
#amp_x sets the volume of the piece, use 0 to turn the piece off
#also keep the values under 5 to avoid compression and clipping
#
#trigger_x is a ring that has 1 for 'hit' and 0 for 'dont'
#2 is used for 'soft' hits, except for the hihat
#
#unit_x controls the note length

#This is Measures / Minute, not Beats
use_bpm 25 # 4/4 with 120BPM => a value of 30
